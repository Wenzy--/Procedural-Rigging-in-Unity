# Procedural-Rigging-in-Unity

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/ekwQmaFU29TuOY0Q3T/giphy.gif)

An experiment about procedural rigging. The code is inspired by
[@FimpossibleC](https://twitter.com/FimpossibleC)'s addon [Tail
Animator](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/tail-animator-121819).

I have made an GPU version to accelerate the process for realtime rigging in
Unity. It was used in my [Test447 video clip](https://twitter.com/i/status/1234605276377968641)

Feel free to contact me. Any ideas about optimization are really appreciated.

[This article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NaGqNgeS8vBYFnbv0L3qiw) in Chinese
explains the gist.
